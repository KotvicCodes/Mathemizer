          This program is made to solve a math problem. You are supposed to find the highest amount of numbers
          with a sum of [insert sum in the input field]. The lowest number may be whichever, but each following
          number must be the multiple of the sum of all of the other numbers.

          The program is designed to print all viable sequences under the button, buckle up and pray for your
          GPU or CPU or whatever :D
